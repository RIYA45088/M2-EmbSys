# Requirements

## Introduction
A temperature sensor is a device used to measure temperature. This can be air temperature, liquid temperature or the temperature of solid matter.. They are used to measure the temperature rise during the process of curing concrete. Temperature meters are used in the geotechnical field to monitor concrete, structures, soil, water, bridges etc. for structural changes in them due to seasonal variations. A temperature sensor is a device that is designed to measure the degree of hotnes or coolnes in  object. The working of a temperature meter depends upon the voltage across the diode. The temperature change is directly proportional to the diode&#39;s resistance. The cooler the temperature, lesser will be the resistance, and vice-versa.The three most common units of measurement for temperature are Celsius, Fahrenheit, and kelvin.

## Research
There are many types of temperature sensors, but, the most common way to categorise them is based upon the mode of connection which includes, contact and non-contact temperature sensors.

## Feature 

-   The system is fast, user friendly.
-   It is very unique.
-   Defines the temperatures at which the sensor is rated to operate safely.
-   Provide accurate measurements.

## Advantages
- Very wide temperature range about -200oC to +2500oC
- Fast response time
- They are a simple construction
- Low initial cost
- Durable
- Easy to read has a clear screen and good scale
- Quick response for any temperature changes
- Precision accuracy in temperature measurement
- It is not easily broken good durability

 ## Disadvantages
 - Not as stable as RTD
 - Recalibration is difficult
 - More susceptible to RFI/EMI
 - They are nonlinear
 - It is used for only temperature measurement only
 - They have a low output voltage
 - Less sensitivity
 -
