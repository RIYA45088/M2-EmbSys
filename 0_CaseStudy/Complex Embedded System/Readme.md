## Motor Control Unit
 MCU converts battery pack DC power source to AC power supply to drive propulsion motor.
 
 ## Sensor Unit
 A sensor is a device, module, machine, or subsystem that detects events or changes in its environment and sends the information to other electronics, frequently a computer processor.
 
 ## Valve Control Unit
 power-operated device used to regulate or manipulate the flow of fluids, such as gas, oil, water, and steam. 
 
 ## Display
 The screen provides information about how the device is working and allows users to interact with it.
 
 ## Water Valve
 Water valves regulate the flow and temperature in pipes and plumbing fixtures.
 
 ## Drain Valve
 A drain valve performs the critical function of allowing excess water vapor to escape into the atmosphere.
