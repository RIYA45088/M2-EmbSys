## Microcontroller
 microcontrollers (MCUs) are used for motor control, analog sensor measurements, front panel keypad control, and LED/LCD displays.
 
 ## Compressor Control
  It circulates the refrigerant throughout the system and adds pressure to the warm part of the circuit, and makes the refrigerant hot. Inside, the refrigerant is cooled down and   condenses, meaning it turns from a gas back into a liquid. It is also known as heart of Refrigerator.
  
  ## Temperature Control
  It maintains a temperature a few degrees above the freezing point of water. It kicks the compressor on when the refrigerator is not cold enough. The refrigerator then turns the compressor off when the desired temperature has been reached.
  
  ## Internal Light
  When depressed by the door closes, the switch interrupts the circuit and shuts the lightbulb off; when the door opens, the switch completes the circuit and causes the             light to illuminate
  
  ## Door Alarm
  If the door of Fridge is left open for the long time. The door alarm gives hint to the user.
  
  ## System Status
  It is a series of consecutive thermodynamic processes that form a cycle that returns the working substance to the same state.
  
  ## LCD
  A liquid-crystal display (LCD) is a flat-panel display or other electronically modulated optical device that uses the light-modulating properties of liquid.
  
  ## User Interface
  The user interface (UI) is the point at which human users interact with a computer, website or application. The goal of effective UI is to make the user's experience easy and      intuitive, requiring minimum effort on the user's part to receive maximum desired outcome.
  
  ## Serial comm.
  Serial communication is used for all long-haul communication and most computer networks, where the cost of cable and synchronization difficulties make parallel communication impractical.
