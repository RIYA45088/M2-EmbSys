# M2_EmbSys Seat Heating System


A heating system is a mechanism for maintaining temperatures at an acceptable level ,by using thermal energy within Everywhere like home , cars etc. It helps the system to raise the temperature of an enclosed space for the primary purpose of ensuring the comfort of the occupants.The Seat Heating control system is mostly  used to control the temperature of a car seat. When a passenger or a driver of the car sits on the car seat, the button sensor gets activated (which acts as one switch). After that, the user has to turn on the heater(It's called the recirculation button, and it plays an important role in the heat).The temperature sensors work by measuring the temperature that's being given off by the thermostat and/or the coolant itself, and it also  keeps monitoring and recording the temperature and sends the analog value to the microcontroller ATmega328. The microcontroller takes the analog input of the temperature sensor and gives output a temperature value through  USART(universal synchronous and asynchronous receiver and transmitter).
