# Microcontroller
Microcontroller enables to measure the heat output as well as control a circulation pump.

# Sensors
 If your vehicle has automatic climate control, it uses sensors to monitor the cabin, and then opens or closes the blend doors and outside flap as needed to maintain the         temperature have Been set.
 
## Temperature Sensors
Within heating systems, temperature sensors are used to measure the current temperature. They forward the information to a central control where it is compared to the target or set values.
## Button Sensor

# Power Supply
 The purpose of a mains power supply is to convert the power delivered to its input by the sinusoidally alternating mains electricity supply into power available at its output in the form of a smooth and constant direct voltage.Power supply operates on an AC input voltage and generates a DC output voltage.
 
 # Heater Core
 Heater Core basically acts as a heat exchanger. It allows coolant to flow through, and this flow of coolant is regulated by the heater control valve. As the engine's heat is carried by coolant into the heater core, the device starts to get warm.
 
 # Actuator
actuators are those which helps in  operating the blend doors correctly.

 ## LED
 When this Led flicks , it means that the coolant level is running low. It may also mean the possibility of the engine overheating and you need to stop your vehicle immediately.. 
 
# Fan
When you turn on the fan, a blower motor sends the air warmed by the heater core into the cabin.
