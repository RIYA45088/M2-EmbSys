# Heating Core
Heater Core used in heating the cabin of a vehicle. The heater core is a small 'radiator' that is connected to the engine cooling system.

# Heating Control Engine

# Water Pump
A working water pump is vital for the engine; if the water pump doesn't work, the engine will overheat. water pump doesn't need to be changed in regular mileage intervals.The water pump delivers the flow of coolant through the system.

# Hot Coolant
The hot coolant passes down through the radiator, it cools down.

# Thermistor
When the engine reaches normal operating temperature, the thermostat opens, allowing the flow of hot coolant through the radiator. 
The thermistor controls the temperature of the boiler water. On one terminal, it connects to the temperature setting or the potentiometer. Depending on the temperature, it provides a given amount of resistance. 

# Radiators
Radiators work through a heat transfer process called convection. When water in the radiator is heated, the surrounding air is also heated up via convection and this hot air is then moved around the room as the air circulates.

# Blower Motor
The blower motor turns the blower fan, sending the air through your air ducts and into the car .
