## Introduction

A heating system is a mechanism for maintaining temperatures at an acceptable level ,by using thermal energy within Everywhere like home , cars etc. It helps the system to raise the temperature of an enclosed space for the primary purpose of ensuring the comfort of the occupants.The Seat Heating control system is mostly  used to control the temperature of a car seat. When a passenger or a driver of the car sits on the car seat, the button sensor gets activated (which acts as one switch). After that, the user has to turn on the heater(It's called the recirculation button, and it plays an important role in the heat).The temperature sensors work by measuring the temperature that's being given off by the thermostat and/or the coolant itself, and it also  keeps monitoring and recording the temperature and sends the analog value to the microcontroller ATmega328. The microcontroller takes the analog input of the temperature sensor and gives output a temperature value through  USART(universal synchronous and asynchronous receiver and transmitter).

## Components used
- ATMEGA 328
- Temperature Sensors
- LCD ( liquid crystal display)
- LED (Light-emitting diode) 
- Heater core
- Thermostat

# SWOT Analysis

## Strength
- Energy Saving
- Increased Comfort
- Enhanced Air Quality
- Lower Cost of Repairs
- Reliable

## Weakness
- maintenance requirements that it takes to operate these more complex systems.
- Its not energy-efficient

## Threats
- The system cannot be used for high Temperature.
- High electric Resistance can make the heater pad to get over heat.

## Opportunties
- require little time and expense to implement.
- will consume less energy.
- cost less money to operate.

## What
Heated seats can make cars  more comfortable in the winter, or for those who often get cold even in the summer. The heater in most vehicles work well, but the car's seat warmer is close to your body allowing you to warm up faster.

## When
Heated front seats not only offer luxurious comfort, relaxation and benefits for physical health, but also increase safety. Heating seats and backrests ensures a high level of well-being and prevents a cramped posture. Winter clothes limiting freedom of movement can be dispensed with. This also results in better operation of the restraint system by reducing the slack in safety belts. People with back or kidney problems benefit from a possible reduction of pain. It is mostly used in cars.

## Where
The car seats

## Why
Heating system in your vehicle is designed to keep you warm, comfortable, and many more advantages. It helps to reduce the pain for the old persons the hot seats gives the relaxation to them.

## How
The longer the seat cushion stays on, the hotter it gets. If it were to stay on for too long, it would get hot enough to become uncomfortable or even dangerous to sit in. It could even start a fire in the cushion. To prevent this, most car seat heaters have a thermostat. The thermostat measures the temperature in the cushion. When it reaches a certain temperature, the thermostat sends a signal, automatically turning off the relay until the seat cools down a bit. At that point, the thermostat turns the relay back on again.
